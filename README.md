# Mass Effect Legendary Edition Tweaks and fixes!

* Add ingame Console
* Toggle Vignette (Annoying black corners, really helpful if you are using OLED, makes the screen much more bright) (Press Numpad zero ingame to toggle vignette)
* Toggle Launcher Intro Movie and music. (I found the Intro movie to be slow and annoying, and the music way to loud)

The bat files, disable and enable intro movies and music in the launcher. (Remember to change the game path in each file before running them)

Copy the ME1, ME2, and ME3 folders to the main game folder.
